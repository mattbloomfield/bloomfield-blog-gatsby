As many of you know, a few weeks ago we all started hearing about Coronavirus. A few days later, we were watching Italy fall apart. And then, seemingly all at once, all the toilet paper disappeared in the United States and we all got quarantined to our houses. 

For many, this seems to be a difficult time. Social media seems to be inundated with posts about how to survive time with your children and spouse. Every one of my meetings at work has started with something along the line of, "How are you doing? Are you hanging in there?" 

I've found it rather curious. For our family, nothing has changed aside from me not spending two hours in the car every day. It could be that it's just fortunately timed with our children's ages. But I think it has to do more with self-reliance than anything else.
